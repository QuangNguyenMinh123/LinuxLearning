This is the first booting stage of BBB, code will be run straight from ROM. THis stage is called RBL
ROM code is loaded from manufaturer and cannot be

| Start up | -> | Init | -> | __main() - (stack setup) | -> | main() | -> | MPU WDT1 setup | -> | Clock Init | -> | Booting |
+----------+    +------+    +--------------------------+    +--------+    +----------------+    +------------+    +---------+

MPU WDT1 setup:
    WDT1 is init for 3 mins, this means if the RBL could not be able to load the 2nd stage bootloader within 3 mins, then
    WDT will expire and reset the MPU

Clock Init:
    Check the value of SYSBOOT[15:14] (table 26-5, page 4102) to decide the value of external crystal value connected to SOC.

RBL will config SOC to run at 500Mhz and this cannot be changed during this stage. But SOC freq can be changed during 2nd stage

/** Load process **/
RBL searches for MLO or SPL
When SOC finds the 2nd stage boot loader on the eMMC then the ROM code copies the MLO/SPL to the internal RAM of the SOC.
MLO or SPL has its own image header contains some infos like load address, size of image to follow, etc.
RBL load MLO to the internal RAM address indicated by image header of the MLO
After loading, RBL kickstarts the execution of the MLO

/* Sumary */
1. Stack setup
2. WDT T1 configuration - 3 mins
3. System clock config
4. Search for MLO or SPL
5. Copy MLO/SPL to the internal SRAM of the chip
6. Execute MLO/SPL
