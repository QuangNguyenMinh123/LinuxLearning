- ROM boot loader:
    Very first piece of code to run on SOC when power is supplied to the board.
    Written by vendor and stored in ROM of the SOC during production of the chip, an cannot be changed.
    Major job is to load and run the Second Stage boot loader: SPL and MLO
- SPL/MLP:
    The job of the Second stage bootloader is to load and execute the 3rd stage bootloader such as U-boot
- U-boot:
    The job of 3rd stage is to load and run the Linux kernel
/** Boot option **/
BBB can boot from: NAND Flash, NOR Flash, USB, eMMC, SD card, Ethernet, UART, SPI
That means, you can keep the boot images in any of the above memory or peripheral and you can able to boot this SOC.
Please go to the page number 4106 of the RM and check. 

Letâ€™s take an example. When SYSBOOT [4:0] = 00001b. After the RESET if SYSBOOT [4:0] = 00001b , then SOC will try to boot
 from UART0 first , if fails, then it tries to boot from XIP(XIP stands for eXutable In Place memory like NOR Flash), if 
 that also fails, then it will try to boot from MMC0, if no success, finally it tries to boot from SPI0, if that also fails, 
 then SOC outputs the error message and stops. 

In BBB, normally SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11100, when you press the button S2, SYS_BOOT2 will be grounded thus SYSBOOT[4:0]= 11000
1. S2 Released (SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11100). The boot order will be
    MMC1 (eMMC)
    MMC0 (SD card)
    UART0
    USB0
2. S2 pressed (SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11000). The boot order will be
    SPI0
    MMC0 (SD card)
    USB0
    UART0
